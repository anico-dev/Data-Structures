1. **2.** Course Learning Outcomes

Student should be able to:

**CLO1:** Analyze algorithms and algorithm correctness.

**CLO2:** Analyze time complexities of algorithms using asymptotic analysis.

**CLO3:** To summarize searching and sorting techniques.

**CLO4:** Describe stack, queue and linked list operation. And can compare between different data structures. Pick an

**           ** appropriate data structure for a design situation.

**CLO5:** Explain the major graph and tree algorithms and their analyses. Employ graphs to model engineering problems,

**             ** when appropriate.

**CLO6:** Use pointers to overcome the memory access problems.
